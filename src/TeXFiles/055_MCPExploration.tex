%=============================================================================

This chapter documents exploratory research on the Model Context Protocol
(MCP). The purpose was to evaluate MCP as an approach for standardizing how
language models interact with external tools, resources, and application
context. This exploration was conducted during the early research phase and
informed later architectural decisions, but MCP was not adopted as a core
dependency in subsequent LangGraph-based development.

\section{Why MCP Was Explored}
\label{sec:MCP_Why}
%=============================================================================

As AI-assisted systems become more integrated into production applications, a
recurring challenge is how to expose tools, data sources, and application
context to language models in a consistent and reusable manner. Early agent
prototypes often rely on tightly coupled, framework-specific integrations,
making it difficult to reuse tooling across models or platforms.

The Model Context Protocol was explored as a response to this problem.
Introduced as an open protocol, MCP aims to standardize how models discover and
invoke tools, access structured resources, and receive contextual information
from external systems~\cite{anthropicMCP}. In principle, this abstraction
promises improved interoperability between models, tooling, and host
applications.

From a research perspective, MCP aligned well with the internship’s early
objectives: understanding interface boundaries, experimenting with
model-to-system contracts, and evaluating whether protocol-level abstractions
could simplify agent integration across heterogeneous environments. This made
MCP a suitable candidate for exploratory evaluation, even though its maturity
for production use remained uncertain.

\section{MCP Conceptual Model}
\label{sec:MCP_Conceptual}
%=============================================================================

MCP defines a clear separation between model clients and external systems
through an explicit server boundary. Rather than embedding tool logic directly
into an agent or framework, an MCP server advertises capabilities that models
can discover and invoke dynamically.

The protocol distinguishes three primary elements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Tools}, which represent executable actions exposed to the
          model through a well-defined interface.
    \item \textbf{Resources}, which provide structured or semi-structured data
          that models can query or retrieve.
    \item \textbf{Context}, which supplies metadata and environmental
          information required to ground model behavior.
\end{itemize}

In this model, the client (typically an LLM runtime or agent framework) does
not require prior knowledge of application-specific APIs. Instead, it relies
on the MCP server to describe available capabilities at runtime. This shifts
integration complexity away from the model toward a protocol-driven interface
layer.

For this research, interoperability was understood as the ability to reuse the
same tool and resource definitions across different model providers and agent
implementations without rewriting integration logic. MCP provided a concrete
mechanism to evaluate whether such decoupling could be achieved in practice.

\section{Prototype Architecture and Experiments}
\label{sec:MCP_Prototype}
%=============================================================================

To evaluate MCP in practice, a lightweight prototype was implemented. The
prototype MCP server exposed a limited set of tools and resources backed by
existing application APIs. The goal was to understand developer ergonomics,
protocol clarity, and runtime behavior rather than feature completeness.

The experimental setup consisted of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An MCP server advertising a small number of application-specific
          tools.
    \item A client-side agent invoking these tools through MCP abstractions.
    \item Manual inspection of tool invocation behavior and response handling.
\end{itemize}

While the prototype demonstrated basic interoperability, several limitations
became apparent. Tool invocation semantics were heavily dependent on model
behavior, making outcomes sensitive to prompt phrasing and model capabilities.
The lack of strong, enforceable contracts at the protocol level made it
difficult to guarantee correct or safe tool usage in non-trivial scenarios.

Security considerations emerged as a significant concern. Recent research has
shown that minimally scoped MCP servers can enable unintended data exfiltration
or cross-tool abuse if not carefully
designed~\cite{croce2025trojans,song2025attack}. These findings reinforced the
importance of strong governance and validation mechanisms, particularly in
production environments.

\section{Outcomes and Lessons}
\label{sec:MCP_Outcomes}
%=============================================================================

The MCP exploration yielded several insights that influenced subsequent design
decisions. While the protocol offers an appealing abstraction for tool
interoperability, its practical application revealed trade-offs between
flexibility, safety, and determinism.

        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

A key outcome was a refined understanding of interface design for AI systems.
Protocol-level abstractions can reduce coupling and improve reuse, but they do
not remove the need for explicit control over execution flow, validation, and
safety. These observations motivated a later shift toward more structured
orchestration approaches, where state transitions and execution paths are
explicitly modeled.

The MCP exploration served its intended purpose as a research probe. It
clarified the limits of protocol-driven interoperability and provided useful
contrast to later work on stateful, workflow-oriented agent systems.
